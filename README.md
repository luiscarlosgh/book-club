## Book Club Repo 📚
Welcome to our Book Club, where literature meets lively discussion!
This repository is a space for Luis, Juna, and Andrea to explore books together, sharing insights, questions, and reflections. Each book will be organized as a project, with issues dedicated to its chapters, themes, and ideas.

## How It Works:
- 📖 Projects represent books we read.
- 🗂️ Issues serve as discussion points for each chapter.
- 💬 Comments are where we exchange ideas and perspectives.
- 🔖 Labels help organize topics (e.g., Characters, Themes, Writing Style).
